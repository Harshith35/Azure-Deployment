    <p>
        Chandrayaan-3 is India’s third lunar mission, which aims to achieve a soft landing on the Moon’s south pole. The spacecraft consists of an orbiter, a lander, and a rover 1. The development phase of Chandrayaan-3 commenced in January 2020, with scientists and engineers working on the spacecraft’s design and assembly 2. The lander, named Vikram after ISRO’s founder Vikram Sarabhai, has undergone improvements for reliability compared to its predecessor. Its weight has been increased by 280kg, and it carries extra fuel to ensure a steady course to the lunar surface 3.

        Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft with an orbiter, lander, and a rover lifted off at 14:35 on Friday (09:05 GMT) from Sriharikota space centre. The lander is due to reach the Moon on 23-24 August. If successful, India will be only the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union, and China 14.

The successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the moon is a historic moment for India, making it one of only four nations to have demonstrated lunar soft landing capability, after Russia, the US and China
